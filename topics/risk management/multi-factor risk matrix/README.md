# Risk methods

* Risk = Propability (P)     * Impact
* Risk = Propability (P1*P2) * Impact
* Impact is always the same, severity is never lowered, only probability
* Probability can be split into technical and consequential events
* Probability can be determined before and after mitigation
* Mitigation can be done via technical mitigation and via risk mitigation
